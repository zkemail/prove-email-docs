# ZK Email Documentation Hub

Welcome to the ZK Email Documentation Hub, the central repository for comprehensive documentation on the ZK Email project suite. This hub serves as your one-stop guide to understanding and implementing our email verification solutions powered by zero-knowledge proof technology.

## ZK Email Project Repos

We have several repos within the ZK Email ecosystem. Developers can use these to build their own custom email verification circuits.

[ZK Email Verifier](https://github.com/zkemail/zk-email-verify): Build custom circuits, smart contracts, and frontend utils. This SDK will likely require ZK knowledge to be able to use.

[Email Wallet](https://github.com/zkemail/email-wallet): A smart contract wallet controlled by your email.

[Email Wallet Extensions SDK](https://github.com/zkemail/email-wallet-sdk): Define email wallet commands to interact with smart contracts automatically, only by writing Solidity.

[ZK Regex](https://github.com/zkemail/zk-regex): A library to do regex verification in circom. The zk-regex CLI takes in a regex and outputs a ZK circuit.

## Projects that use ZK Email

There are many real world applications that currently use our sdks. Here's a list of a few notable ones

* [ZKP2P: Decentralized Venmo <> USDC Bridge](https://zkp2p.xyz/)
* [ZK Email Safe: 2FA for on-chain transactions](https://ethglobal.com/showcase/zkemail-safe-z8dps)
* [Email Wallet: Send transactions via email, including account recovery!](https://emailwallet.org)
* [Nozee: Anonymous Proofs of Email Domain via JWTs](https://nozee.xyz)
* [Proof of Twitter: Verify your twitter username on chain using zk proofs](https://twitter.prove.email/)

## Quick Start

To get started with [Prove.email](https://prove.email/), follow these steps:

1. **Choose the Project Component**: Select the project component you're interested in from our list of SDKs, templates, and examples.
2. **Read the README Guide**: Each section comes with a "README" guide. Make sure to read it to understand how the technology works and to get started with the basic setup.
3. **Dive into Specific Documentation**: For detailed information and advanced configurations, delve into the specific documentation of the component you've chosen. Check out our [How to Set Up Proof of Twitter Example](https://prove.email/blog/twitter) blog post for a step-by-step tutorial showcasing a practical example of how our SDKs can be implemented.
4. **Regularly Check for Updates**: Since we frequently make changes to enhance functionality and security, it's crucial to keep your circuits package up-to-date.

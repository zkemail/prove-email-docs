# Running the Example

This guide will help to run the example project to test out the generated circuit.

### Getting started

You only need a standard `node` environment to run the example.

Start by downloding the example from the registry home page

### Example project directory structure

```
example/
├─ node_modules/
├─ circuit/
│  ├─ regex/
│  |  ├─ field.json
|  |  ├─ fieldRegex.circom
│  ├─ proof.circom
├─ lib/
│  ├─ generate_inputs.js
├─ index.ts
├─ generate_inputs_worker.js
├─ package.json
├─ tsconfig.json
```

**Circuit Directory**

```
├─ circuit/
│  ├─ proof.circom
│  ├─ regex/
│  |  ├─ field.json
|  |  ├─ fieldRegex.circom
```

This folder contains all the circuits that were auto-generated by the metadata from the pattern. You shouldn't directly edit the circom files in the `regex/` directory. Use the `zk-regex` SDK to generate it from your `field.json` files.

`zk-regex decomposed -d field.json -c fieldRegex.circom -t fieldRegex -g true`

`circuit/proof.circom` will be the main entry point for the circuit. Later you will see that this is imported in the tests.

**Library**

```
├─ lib/
│  ├─ generate_inputs.js
```

This folder only contains a script to generate the circuit inputs from a given email. The output of the script will be directly used in the circuit for proof generation

**Worker Script**

```
├─ generate_inputs_worker.js
```

This script is used by the Registry SDK when generating circuit inputs in the browser. It basically acts as a sandboxed environment using WebWorkers to convert an email to circuit inputs.

**Test Entry Point**

```
├─ index.ts
```

This is the test entry point. You will need to paste in your raw email in a variable in the file before running it.

### Unzip the project and install dependencies

```
cd example
yarn install | npm install
```

### Add your raw email sample

index.ts

```
...
const rawEmail = `<paste your eml file here>`
...
```

### Run the test

```
yarn/npm start
```

Once the witness generation is successful, the circuit works.
